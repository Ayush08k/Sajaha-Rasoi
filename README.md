## 🚩 The Problem

India's vibrant street food economy faces a critical, often overlooked challenge: the **daily sourcing of raw materials**. Street food vendors work on thin margins, and unsold perishable goods at the end of the day—like chopped vegetables, paneer, or batter—translate into **direct financial loss and food waste**.

Meanwhile, nearby vendors may be in urgent need of those exact items but are forced to either close early or incur expenses sourcing them from distant markets.

---

## 💡 The Solution — *Saajha Rasoi*

**Saajha Rasoi** is a **mobile-first web application** that acts as a **hyper-local peer-to-peer marketplace**, enabling vendors to sell surplus perishable items to nearby vendors in real time.

### ✅ Benefits for All:
- **Sellers** recover some cost from potential food waste.
- **Buyers** get ingredients quickly at a lower price.
- **Communities** benefit from reduced food waste and stronger vendor cooperation.

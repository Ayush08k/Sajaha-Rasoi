## 🚩 Problem Statement

India’s thriving street food ecosystem faces a silent but severe issue—**daily food waste due to unsold perishable materials.** Vendors operate on razor-thin margins, and any leftover prepared food or ingredients (like paneer, chopped veggies, dosa batter) often go to waste, leading to financial and material loss. Meanwhile, another vendor nearby might be in desperate need of those exact items.
